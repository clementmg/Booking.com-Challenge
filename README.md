# Booking.com-Challenge

This is my work on https://www.bookingchallenge.com/ organized in 2020/2021.
I finished in 11th place.

You can find all the information in the <a href="https://github.com/clementmg/Booking.com-Challenge/blob/main/Deep_Learning_Project_Cl%C3%A9ment_Martin-Gougenheim.pdf" target="_top">Pdf</a> I wrote on the topic.

Have a good read!
